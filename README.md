# CornerGrocer
Tracking items at a local corner grocery store.


1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    An app tracking the quantity of a list of items at a local corner grocery store.

2. What did you do particularly well?
    Broke the program down into digestible components and helper functions, making it quite modular.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    Get rid of _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS definition. It would allow me to address the warnings from deprecation.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    I found a really nifty method to color code the menus. I'm adding that to the repertoire.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    Debugging the Python to C++ connection.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    Small code chunks in the form of modular code and helper functions.
